This as a prototype of s/key implementation. 
The client hashes the password n-1 times and sends that value to the server
which hashes that value one more time and compares it to its solution.
If it checks out then the user gets access, and the server stores the value that
client sent, the password hashed n-1 times. 

This allows a secure message to be sent so that even if an attack successfully
because this hash will never be used again by the server. 

The major drawback is that it takes significant computation power to calculate
the sums for a large n.

This implementation uses sha256 for secure hashing.


skeysetup.sh is run with:
sh skeysetup.sh [password] [n]

skey.sh is run with:
sh skey.sh [password]
this command can be run n number of times before locking out.
